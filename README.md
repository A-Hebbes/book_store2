# The Bookstore

The Bookstore Wexford is an E-commerce site for a shop specialising in quality paperback books at affordable prices. The project aims to bring the joy of reading to book lovers both locally in Wexford and nationwide through an accessible, online platform.

Users can browse a wide range of books spanning various genres, from fiction and non-fiction to works by Irish authors and international bestsellers. They can easily add books to their cart and proceed to checkout.

A key focus of the project was to create a user-friendly front-end interface for the business owner. This allows them to manage the shop and update inventory without needing to access the Django Admin panel.

The Bookstore Wexford also integrates with another site, 'Book Blog', fostering a community of readers who can share their thoughts and find new literary inspirations. This integrated retail and community aspect creates a comprehensive platform for the book lovers.

## UX

The design of The Bookstore Wexford was created with the user experience in mind. The goal was to create an inviting, easy-to-navigate online bookshop that reflects the warm, welcoming atmosphere of a physical bookshop whilst providing the convenience of online shopping.


### Scope
Key features were identified to meet user needs:
- A comprehensive catalogue of books with detailed information
- Easy-to-use search and filter functions
- A streamlined checkout process
- Integration with the 'Book Blog' for community engagement

### Structure
The site is structured to guide users naturally from browsing to purchase:
- Home page introducing the bookshop and featuring highlighted books
- Catalogue pages with filter options
- Individual book pages with more detailed information
- Shopping basket and checkout process

### Skeleton
Wireframes were created for key pages to plan the layout and ensure a consistent, responsive design across devices.

### Surface
The visual design aims to create a calm, inviting atmosphere conducive to browsing books:
- A clean, uncluttered layout
- A colour scheme matched to the background image of a cosy reading space
- Typography that's easy to read 


### Colour Scheme

The colour palette for The Bookstore Wexford was carefully selected to complement the warm, inviting atmosphere of the background image, which depicts a cosy reading space. The chosen colours aim to create a sense of comfort, reminding users of a traditional bookshop:

- **Primary Background**: A soft, warm beige (`rgba(253, 236, 200, 0.9)`) is used for content containers, giving the feeling of aged paper and providing a gentle contrast to the text.

- **Primary Text**: Charcoal (`#333`) ensures readability while being softer than pure black, reducing eye strain during extended reading sessions.

- **Accent Colour**: A rich navy blue (`#2c3e50`) is used for buttons, headers, and interactive elements.

- **Accent Hover**: A slightly lighter blue (`#34495e`) is employed for hover states, providing feedback for interactive elements.

- **Footer Background**: The navy blue (`#2c3e50`) is repeated in the footer.

- **Footer Text**: Pure white (`#ffffff`) is used for footer text to ensure maximum contrast and readability against the dark background.

This colour scheme was chosen to create a harmonious, book-friendly environment that encourages browsing and reading, while ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/fdecc8-333333-2c3e50-34495e-ffffff-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

The typography for The Bookstore Wexford was chosen to enhance readability and create a clean, modern aesthetic that complements the inviting atmosphere of the site:

- **Primary Font**: The main typeface used throughout the site is 'Roboto' which was chosen for its readability across screen sizes whilst maintaining a welcoming feel.

- **Fallback Fonts**: In the event that Roboto fails to load, the site falls back to the default sans-serif font of the user's system. This ensures that the text remains readable and the layout intact, regardless of the user's device or system settings.

- **Logo and Headers**: For the bookshop logo and main headers, uppercase styling with increased letter spacing (2px) was used. This distinguishes the look for important text elements, helping them stand out from the body and reinforcing brand identity.

- **Font Sizes**: The site uses a responsive typography scale, ensuring that text is legible on all devices. Font sizes are set in rem units, allowing for easy scaling based on the user's preferred browser settings.
